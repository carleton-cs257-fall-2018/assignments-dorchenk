Land Me Where?
Kellen Dorchen, November 2018

This project is an attempt to simulate what
it would be like to land on an object of x mass
and some size y, as a person falling at some
initial velocity.

This is a design patter problem because the simulation
requires an effective representation of gravity which
is a commonly solved problem among game creators.
